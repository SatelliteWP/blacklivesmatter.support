If you are reading this, maybe there is a reason. You are wondering who created this website and why?

The answer comes from our wish that we all live together in peace and... this quote:

"First they came for the communists 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a communist.

Then they came for the socialists, 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the jews, 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a jew.

Then they came for me 
And there was no one left 
To speak for me."

-Martin NiemÃ¶ller

As for who created this, let's just say we are actors with good intentions.

Peace.

			<h2>Why was this site created?</h2>
			<p>May 25th, 2020. Minneapolis, USA.</p>
			<p>We all witnessed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd" title="Killing of George Floyd">assasination of a black man</a> that would change history forever.</p>
			<p>This was not the first time something like this happened.</p>
			<p>Over the years, weâ€™ve heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">many similar stories</a>.</p>
			<p>This must stop.</p>
			<p>Now.</p>
			<p>Donâ€™t be a witness anymore.</p>
			<p>Become an actor.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<h2>How can I be part of the solution?</h2>
			<p>Here is what you can do:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Get in touch with at least one person that might be affected (directly or not) by racism and genuinely ask if they need anythingâ€¦ and listen.</li>
				<li>On June 10, 11 and 12 2020, make your homepage colorless by using the script below to raise awareness about the situation. See below <a href="#code">how you can do that</a>.</li>
				<li>Take some time to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=black+lives+matter" target="_blank">educate yourself</a> about the #blacklivesmatter. We wonâ€™t tell you what to thinkâ€¦ we trust you. What can you do that will have an impact in your business or environment.</li>
				<li><a href="#share">Share this website</a> on your social media and tag at least 3 website owners you know that can make their homepage colorless too. Make sure to include your reflection about what you will do to make an impact.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You donâ€™t have to change the world by yourself.</p>
			<p>But you must not only be a witness anymore.</p>
			<p>Become an actor.</p>
			<p>Act on it.</p>

			<p>
				It is really simple! Ask your webmaster to include the following code before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> closing tag:
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>
					&lt;script src=&quot;https://www.blacklivesmatter.support/js/blms.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
				</code>
			</p>
			<p>Your homepage will become colorless only during these 3 days.</p>
			<p>There is nothing else to do!</p>

			<h4>Do you have a plugin for WordPress?</h4>
			<p>Of course! First, <a href="/blms.zip" title="Support BlackLivesMatter WordPress plugin">download the plugin</a>.</p>
			<p>Then, login your dashboard and goto Plugins > Add new. Install the plugin and activate it!</p>

			<h4>How can I validate taht the code will work?</h4>
			<p>Simply add <code>?blms_simulation</code> at the end of your homepage URL in your browser and you should see your homepage colorless!</p>
			<p></p>

			<h4>Does it work on any website?</h4>
			<p>It should. That being said, we are using the CSS filter instruction to convert your website to black and white. This might not work in every case. For instance, there are limitaions in Microsoft Edge (and Internet explorer!) if you are using z-index. You might have to add more code to make your homepage 100% colorless.</p>
