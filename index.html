If you are reading this, maybe there is a reason. You are wondering who created this website and why?

The answer comes from our wish that we all live together in peace and... this quote:

"First they came for the communists 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a communist.

Then they came for the socialists, 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the jews, 
And I did not speak out 
Because I was not a jew.

Then they came for me 
And there was no one left 
To speak for me."

-Martin Niemöller

As for who created this, let's just say we are people who think there's only one race: the human race.

Peace.

			<h2>Why was this site created?</h2>
			<p>May 25th, 2020. Minneapolis, USA.</p>
			<p>We all witnessed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd" title="Killing of George Floyd" target="_blank">assasination of a black man</a> that has now started a movement.</p>
			<p>This was not the first time something like this happened.</p>
			<p>Over the years, we’ve heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States" title="Racism in the United States" target="_blank">many similar stories</a>.</p>
			<p>This must stop.</p>
			<p>Now.</p>
			<p>Don’t be a witness anymore.</p>
			<p>Become an actor.</p>

			<h2>How can I become part of the solution?</h2>
			<p>Here is what you can do:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Get in touch with at least one person that might be affected (directly or not) by racism and genuinely ask if they need anything… and listen.</li>
				<li>Take some time to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=black+lives+matter" title="Black Lives Matter" target="_blank">educate yourself</a> about the #blacklivesmatter movement. We won’t tell you what to think… we trust you. See what you could do to make an impact in your business or environment.</li>
				<li>On June 10, 11 and 12 2020, make your homepage colorless by using the script below to raise awareness about the situation. See below <a href="#code">how to do this</a>.</li>
				<li><a href="#share">Share this website</a> on your social media accounts and tag other website owners you think should make their homepage colorless too. Make sure you also share your thoughts on what you plan on doing to become part of the solution.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You don’t have to change the world by yourself.</p>
			<p>But remaining a silent witness isn't enough.</p>
			<p>Become an agent of change.</p>
			<p>Take action.</p>

			<p>
				It is really simple! Ask your webmaster to include the following code before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> closing tag:
			</p>
			<p>
				<div class="codestyle">
					&lt;script src=&quot;https://blacklivesmatter.support/js/blms.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
				</div>
			</p>
			<p>Your homepage will become colorless only during those 3 days.</p>
			<p>There is nothing else to do!</p>

			<h4>Do you have a plugin for WordPress?</h4>
			<p>Of course! First, <a href="/blms.zip" title="Support #BlackLivesMatter WordPress Plugin">download the plugin</a>.</p>
			<p>Then, from your WordPress Dashboard, access the Plugins > Add New menu. Install the plugin and activate it!</p>

			<h4>How can I validate that the code will work?</h4>
			<p>Simply add <code>?blms_simulation</code> at the end of your website URL in your browser and you should see your colorless homepage!</p>
			<p></p>

			<h4>Does it work on any website?</h4>
			<p>It should. That being said, we are using the CSS filter instruction to convert your website to B&W. This may not work in every case. For instance, there are limitaions in Microsoft Edge (and Internet Explorer!) if you are using z-index. You may have to add more code to make your homepage 100% colorless.</p>
